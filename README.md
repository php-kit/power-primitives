# Power Primitives
##### PHP's arrays and strings as chainable, composable, object-oriented constructs

## Introduction

*TO DO: provide an explanation of the rationale behind this library and some usage examples.*

## Documentation

Most functions already have a *doc-block* (inline documentation), so your IDE should give you inline documentation and parameter validation and autocompletion.

Nevertheless, additional documentation (to be displayed on this Readme or on the project's Wiki) is still being written, whenever we find the time for it.

Are you in a hurry? You can volunteer for writing documentation. We welcome your pull requests ;-)

## Usage

#### Installation

On the command-line, type:

```sh
composer require php-kit/power-primitives
```

#### Runtime requirements
